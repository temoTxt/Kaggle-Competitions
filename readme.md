# M5 Forecasting - Uncertainty

https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-uncertainty/overview


## Development

You can sync the repo and run notebooks locally, or edit on Google Colab https://colab.research.google.com/
* Click on the notebook in github, and then click on the *Open in Colab* badge on the top of the file
* To save from Google Collab, click *file > save a copy in Github*, then authorize Google Colab with
Oauth and save to master branch in *skedrastic/m5-forecasting-uncertainty*
* **Important** When using Google Colab you get 12GB ram. You can also use a pretty strong GPU instance. However, I think you should only add the GPU to your runtime when you are ready to start training your model. I think Google may have an algorithm that allocates GPU resources and they would maybe throttle if they see you using all the time, rather than just when you need it
